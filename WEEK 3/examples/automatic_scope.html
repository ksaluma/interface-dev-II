<p>If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    
function myFunction() {
    carName = "Volvo";
}
    
myFunction();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Once the variable is created inside \"myFunction\", outside the function I can still display " + carName;

</script>
<p><em>It is generally NOT a good idea to let this happen.</em></p>
